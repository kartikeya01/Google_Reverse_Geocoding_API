## Functions and Usability
- Includes the Google Maps API in the center of the page
- By default, the marker location and geolocation is set to my house address
- Once the user clicks the "Reverse to Address" animated button, they are taken to the address of the inputted geolocation
- The user also has the ability to change the geolocation and view it on the map as well as read its physical address
